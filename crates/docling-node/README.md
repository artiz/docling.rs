# docling.rs (Node.js / Bun bindings)

Native [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) / [Bun](https://bun.sh) bindings for
[docling.rs](https://github.com/docling-project/docling.rs) — a Rust port of
[docling](https://github.com/docling-project/docling). Convert Markdown, HTML,
DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, EPUB, ODF, LaTeX, email, PDF, images and more into a unified
`DoclingDocument`, and export it as **Markdown** or docling-core **JSON**.

Built with [napi-rs](https://napi.rs), so it ships a real native addon (`.node`)
that loads in both Node.js and Bun (Bun implements N-API) — the same binary, no
rebuild between runtimes.

## Install

Released versions ship **prebuilt** native binaries, so no Rust toolchain is
needed to use the package:

```bash
npm install docling.rs   # or: bun add docling.rs
```

Prebuilt platforms: Linux x64 / arm64 / s390x (glibc) and Windows x64 — on
IBM Z the addon loads ONNX Runtime at run time from the library
`download_dependencies.sh` fetches (#504). (macOS isn't
prebuilt — build from source, see below.) The right binary is pulled in
automatically as a platform-specific `optionalDependency` (`docling.rs-<triple>`). Releases are published to npm
automatically by the `npm publish` workflow
(`.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml`) whenever CI cuts a GitHub Release
(`v<version>`): the release tag is built and published at its version, together
with `docling.rs-cuda` and `docling.rs-wasm`. The workflow can also be run by
hand — by default it builds the latest master (the workspace version), or pass
a release tag to (re-)publish that; versions already on npm are skipped.

## Build from source

This package lives in the docling.rs Cargo workspace and can also build the
addon from Rust source — needed for local development or an unsupported
platform. You need a Rust toolchain (1.92+) and Node.js 14+ (or Bun).

```bash
cd crates/docling-node
npm install          # installs @napi-rs/cli
npm run build        # release build → docling.rs.<platform>.node + native.js/.d.ts
# npm run build:debug  # faster, unoptimized
```

> The addon statically links the ONNX runtime used by the PDF/image pipeline, so
> the built `.node` is large. Declarative formats (Markdown, HTML, DOCX, …) don't
> touch it; only PDF/image conversion loads the ML models (downloaded on first
> use, like the CLI) — and not even that under `pipeline: 'vlm'`, which converts
> through a remote endpoint.

### GPU (CUDA)

The regular `docling.rs` npm binaries are CPU-only. For NVIDIA GPU inference
in the PDF/image ML pipeline (issue #74 — same mechanism as the CLI and the
`docling-rs-cuda` Python wheel) there are two routes:

**Install the [`docling.rs-cuda`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docling.rs-cuda)
package** (Linux x64). Same JS API; the npm tarball is a few KB and its
`postinstall` downloads the CUDA addon + ONNX Runtime provider libraries from
this repo's matching `npm-cuda-v<version>` GitHub release, verifying each
file against the release's sha256 manifest (the binaries are far past npm's
practical size limits — the same fetch-at-install model `onnxruntime-node`
uses). Requires glibc ≥ 2.38 (Ubuntu 24.04+ era), CUDA 12 + cuDNN 9 at
runtime, and `github.com` access at install time — or set
`DOCLING_RS_NPM_CUDA_URL` to a mirror base URL / local directory with the
same assets (air-gapped installs). To keep existing `require('docling.rs')`
code unchanged, install it under an npm alias:

```bash
npm install docling.rs-cuda
# or: npm install docling.rs@npm:docling.rs-cuda
```

The package is published by the `npm publish` workflow
(`.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml`) — automatically on every GitHub Release,
or on a manual run with the `cuda` input — which also uploads the release
assets (`crates/docling-node/cuda/` holds the shim sources).

**Or build the addon from source** with the `cuda` feature:

```bash
cd crates/docling-node
export RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-Wl,-rpath,$ORIGIN'   # Linux: find provider libs next to the addon
npm run build:cuda    # = napi build ... --features cuda; fetches the CUDA ONNX Runtime (large)
cp ../../target/release/libonnxruntime_providers_{shared,cuda}.so .
```

The CUDA execution provider is two *separate* shared libraries that ONNX
Runtime dlopens at session start; the `$ORIGIN` rpath makes it look next to
the `.node` addon, so ship them alongside it (without them a CUDA build
falls back to CPU with a warning). CUDA 12 + cuDNN 9 must be installed on the
system. A GPU build defaults to `DOCLING_RS_EP=auto` — GPU when usable, CPU
fallback; set `DOCLING_RS_EP=cuda` to fail loudly instead of falling back, or
`DOCLING_RS_EP=cpu` to force CPU. `tensorrt` / `directml` (Windows) /
`coreml` (macOS) features exist too, matching the Rust crates.

## Quick start

```js
import { convertFile, convert, DocumentConverter } from 'docling.rs'

// Convert a file — format detected from the extension.
const { content } = convertFile('report.docx')
console.log(content) // Markdown

// Convert in-memory bytes (e.g. an upload) — pass the format explicitly.
const md = convert({ name: 'notes', data: Buffer.from('# Hi\n'), format: 'md' })

// docling-core JSON instead of Markdown.
const json = convertFile('report.docx', { to: 'json' })

// Reuse a converter across many documents.
const converter = new DocumentConverter({ strict: true })
const a = converter.convert({ name: 'a.md', data: Buffer.from('# A\n') })
```

CommonJS works too: `const { convertFile } = require('docling.rs')`.

### Async (off the event loop)

Conversion is CPU-bound; the `*Async` variants run it on the libuv thread pool
so the event loop stays free. Prefer these for PDF/image and for servers.

```js
import { convertFileAsync } from 'docling.rs'

const res = await convertFileAsync('paper.pdf', { to: 'json' })
```

### Streaming Markdown

`streamFileMarkdown` yields Markdown chunks in document order as conversion
progresses. For PDF (whose pages convert in parallel) output starts flowing
before the whole document is done; concatenating the chunks reproduces the
buffered `content` byte-for-byte.

```js
import { streamFileMarkdown } from 'docling.rs'

for await (const chunk of streamFileMarkdown('paper.pdf')) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk)
}
```

### Chunking (docling's chunkers, for RAG)

`chunkFile` / `chunk` / `chunkDocument` (each with an `…Async` variant) run
docling's chunkers over a converted document and return embedding-ready
records. The default is the structure-driven **hierarchical** chunker (one
chunk per document item — whole lists, triplet-serialized tables — with its
heading path); pass `chunker: 'hybrid'` to refine against a token budget
(split oversized chunks, merge undersized same-heading neighbours), matching
docling's `HybridChunker`. The hybrid token counts come from a HuggingFace
`tokenizer.json`: pass a path via `tokenizer`, or omit it to use
`models/chunk/tokenizer.json` (all-MiniLM-L6-v2's — fetched by
`scripts/install/download_dependencies.sh` alongside the ML models, resolved through
the same install-home logic).

```js
import { chunkFileAsync, Pipeline, chunkDocumentAsync } from 'docling.rs'

const chunks = await chunkFileAsync('report.docx', {
  chunker: 'hybrid',
  tokenizer: 'tokenizer.json', // e.g. all-MiniLM-L6-v2's
  maxTokens: 256,
})
for (const c of chunks) {
  await embed(c.contextualized) // heading path + text, ready for the embedder
}

// Chunk something you already converted (no re-conversion), e.g. a PDF
// that went through the warm Pipeline:
const { content } = new Pipeline().convertFile('paper.pdf', { to: 'json' })
const pdfChunks = await chunkDocumentAsync(content)
```

Each `Chunk` is `{ text, headings?, docItems, contextualized }` — `docItems`
holds the source items' JSON-pointer refs (`"#/texts/12"`), `contextualized`
is docling's `contextualize()` rendering to feed the embedding model.

#### Streaming chunks

`streamFileChunks` / `streamChunks` / `streamDocumentChunks` are the streaming
counterparts: async generators that yield each chunk **as the chunkers produce
it** — the first chunk is ready for embedding while the rest of the document
is still being chunked, and no all-chunks array is materialized. Abandoning
the generator early (`break`) cancels the background chunking.

```js
import { streamFileChunks } from 'docling.rs'

for await (const c of streamFileChunks('report.docx', {
  chunker: 'hybrid',
  tokenizer: 'tokenizer.json',
  maxTokens: 256,
})) {
  await embed(c.contextualized) // embedding overlaps the remaining chunking
}
```

### PDF / images: getting the ML models

Declarative formats (Markdown, HTML, DOCX, XLSX, …) are pure Rust and need
nothing. The **PDF/image** path needs the ONNX models (layout, OCR,
TableFormer), which are *not* bundled in the addon — the PDF pages themselves
are parsed and rendered in pure Rust. Converting a PDF/image/METS input
**throws** until the models are on disk. Fetch them with a
one-liner from your app's directory (where you'll `npm install docling.rs`):

> The exception is [`pipeline: 'vlm'`](#vlm-pipeline-remote-endpoint), which
> replaces the ONNX stack with a remote endpoint: it needs **nothing on disk**
> (PDF pages are rendered in pure Rust).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docling-project/docling.rs/master/scripts/install/download_dependencies.sh | sh
```

```js
import { convertFileAsync } from 'docling.rs'

const res = await convertFileAsync('paper.pdf', { to: 'markdown' }) // ✅ works
```

`scripts/install/download_dependencies.sh` fetches everything from this repo's
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/docling-project/docling.rs/releases) straight into
`./.models` — which this package (and the Rust CLI) look for by
default, relative to the process's current directory, so no env vars or setup
call are needed afterwards:

| Asset | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| **layout** (`layout_heron.onnx`) | `models/layout_heron.onnx` |
| **OCR** rec model + dictionary | `models/ocr_rec.onnx`, `models/ppocr_keys_v1.txt` |
| **OCR** text detector (optional, #429 — lines outside layout regions on scans/images) | `models/ocr_det.onnx` |
| **TableFormer** | `models/tableformer/{encoder,decoder,bbox}.onnx` |

> **layout + TableFormer are PyTorch→ONNX exports**
> (`docling-project/docling-layout-heron`, Apache-2.0;
> `docling-project/docling-models`, CDLA-Permissive-2.0/Apache-2.0 — see
> [`docs/MODELS_NOTICE.md`](../../docs/MODELS_NOTICE.md) for full attribution), not
> docling.rs's own weights — docling.rs hosts the converted `.onnx` as a
> GitHub Release purely so you don't need a local Python/torch toolchain.
> The OCR model is re-hosted, unmodified, from its own public release, on
> the same host for convenience.
>
> Run it from wherever your app lives — the script only writes to `./.models`
> under the current directory, e.g. in a container build step:
> ```bash
> cd /path/to/your/app && curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docling-project/docling.rs/master/scripts/install/download_dependencies.sh | sh
> ```
>
> To use your own export/host instead, point the env vars at it directly:
> `DOCLING_LAYOUT_ONNX`, `DOCLING_OCR_REC_ONNX`, `DOCLING_OCR_DICT`,
> `DOCLING_TABLEFORMER_{ENCODER,DECODER,BBOX}` — an env var always wins over
> the `./.models` default.

```js
checkDependencies() // { home, layout, ocr, ocrDet, tableformer, chunkTokenizer, ready, missing }
```

`ready` describes the **standard** pipeline (the layout model); a VLM-only
install has `ready: false` and still converts.

### Reusing a warm `Pipeline` (many PDFs)

The one-shot `convertFile` / `convertFileAsync` rebuild the pipeline — reloading
every ONNX model — on each call. To convert many PDFs/images, reuse a `Pipeline`
so the models load **once**:

```js
import { Pipeline } from 'docling.rs'

const pipeline = new Pipeline({ strict: true })
for (const path of pdfPaths) {
  const { content } = await pipeline.convertFileAsync(path, { to: 'json' }) // warm models, off the event loop
}

// Or stream a PDF's Markdown as pages finish converting:
for await (const chunk of pipeline.streamFileMarkdown('paper.pdf')) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk)
}
```

`Pipeline` handles `pdf` and `image` inputs (the ML pipeline). The sync
`convertFile` / `convert` block the event loop; the `*Async` variants run on the
libuv thread pool, and `streamFileMarkdown` yields Markdown chunks in document
order as pages finish. Conversions on one instance run one at a time (the
models are mutable sessions) — overlapping `*Async` calls queue in submission
order, so batch throughput comes from keeping the models warm, not from
parallel calls.

The constructor takes the same PDF/image options as the one-shot calls —
`ocrEngine`, `ocrLang`, `ocrMode`, `ocrScale`, `noOcr` (docling's `--no-ocr`:
never OCR, keep layout and tables; `skipOcr` is its pre-2.0 name),
`textLayerOnly` (the text layer only, no models — what `noOcr` meant before
2.0, #611), `password` (an encrypted PDF's or Office document's password,
#611/#625; `pdfPassword`, its earlier name, still works), `forceFullPageOcr`, `noTextPanels`, `headingHierarchy`, `pages`,
`imagesScale` / `pageImages`
(picture-crop resolution in px per point and the JSON page images, docling's
`images_scale` / `generate_page_images`, #520), `documentTimeout` (a per-document
budget in seconds, docling's `document_timeout`: once spent, the pages done so
far are the document, `status` is `"partial_success"` and `errors` says why,
#497) and the enrichment switches — and
applies them to every conversion on that instance, e.g.
`new Pipeline({ ocrEngine: 'tesseract', ocrLang: 'por+eng' })` for Portuguese
scans. They are validated on `new` exactly as `DocumentConverter` validates
them (an unknown `ocrLang` throws, #471). The per-call `OutputOptions` only
choose the output (`to`, `imageMode`, `artifactsDir`, `pageBreakPlaceholder`).

`Pipeline` rejects `pipeline: 'vlm'`: that pipeline loads no models, so there
is nothing to keep warm — use `convertFileAsync` or `DocumentConverter`.

### VLM pipeline (remote endpoint)

`pipeline: 'vlm'` (issue #77) replaces the whole ONNX stack — layout, OCR,
TableFormer — with a **Vision Language Model**. Each PDF page is rendered (in
pure Rust) and sent to any OpenAI-compatible vision endpoint (LM Studio, Ollama,
vLLM, or a hosted service) with docling's page-conversion prompt; the returned
DocLang/DocTags markup is parsed by the same reader the CLI uses. No ONNX model
is loaded, so a VLM-only install needs nothing on disk.

```js
import { convertFileAsync } from 'docling.rs'

const res = await convertFileAsync('paper.pdf', {
  to: 'markdown',
  pipeline: 'vlm',
  vlmEndpoint: 'http://localhost:11434/v1', // or the full …/chat/completions URL
  vlmModel: 'granite-docling',
  vlmApiKey: process.env.VLM_API_KEY,       // local servers need none
})
```

`vlmEndpoint` / `vlmModel` fall back to `DOCLING_RS_VLM_ENDPOINT` /
`DOCLING_RS_VLM_MODEL`, `vlmApiKey` and `vlmPrompt` to
`DOCLING_RS_VLM_API_KEY` / `DOCLING_RS_VLM_PROMPT`, matching the CLI's
`--pipeline vlm`. Selecting `pipeline: 'vlm'` explicitly is always required —
the environment supplies values, it never switches the pipeline on, so a stale
`DOCLING_RS_VLM_ENDPOINT` can't silently route your PDFs over the network.

> **The `vlm*` options are only read under `pipeline: 'vlm'`.** Passing
> `vlmEndpoint` / `vlmModel` without it is not an error and does not switch
> pipelines: the options are ignored and the conversion runs through the
> standard ONNX pipeline — the same way the CLI parses a stray
> `--vlm-endpoint` given without `--pipeline vlm` and drops it. An option
> configures the VLM; `pipeline` alone selects it. So if a call is loading the
> ML models (or failing on missing ones) when you expected the endpoint to be
> contacted, the missing piece is `pipeline: 'vlm'`.

`pages: 'A-B'` composes (only those pages are rendered and sent), `strict`,
`compactTables`, `allowedFormats` and `to: 'json'` work as usual, and
`streamFileMarkdown` yields the document as a single chunk — a VLM answers a
whole page per request, so there is nothing earlier to emit. PDF and image are
the only accepted inputs; any other format is rejected rather than silently
falling back to the standard pipeline.

The `chunk*` functions have **no** VLM path — `ChunkOptions` carries no
`pipeline`, and they always convert through the ONNX stack. To chunk a
VLM-converted document, convert to JSON first and chunk that:

```js
const { content } = await convertFileAsync('paper.pdf', { to: 'json', pipeline: 'vlm', … })
const chunks = chunkDocument(content, { chunker: 'hybrid' })
```

### Images

Pick how pictures render in Markdown with `imageMode`:

```js
// Inline, self-contained: ![Image](data:image/png;base64,…)
convertFile('slides.pptx', { imageMode: 'embedded' })

// Referenced: links + the image bytes to write yourself.
const res = convertFile('slides.pptx', { imageMode: 'referenced', artifactsDir: 'assets' })
for (const img of res.images) {
  await fs.writeFile(img.path, img.data) // e.g. assets/image_000000.png
}
```

JSON output always embeds extracted images as data URIs.

For scanned PDFs/images, `ocrLang: 'en' | 'ch'` picks the OCR recognition
model (`en` is the default — proper Latin word spacing; `ch` is the
multilingual docling-conformance model; BCP-47 tags for either language —
`'en-US'`, `'eng'`, `'zh'`, `'zh-Hans'`, `'zh-TW'` — resolve to the same two
models, #388), and `pages: 'A-B'` converts only that
1-based PDF page window.

## API

### Functions

| Function | Returns | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `convertFile(path, options?)` | `ConvertResult` | Detects format from the extension. |
| `convert(input, options?)` | `ConvertResult` | In-memory bytes (`{ name, data, format? }`). |
| `convertFileAsync(path, options?)` | `Promise<ConvertResult>` | Off the event loop. |
| `convertAsync(input, options?)` | `Promise<ConvertResult>` | Off the event loop. |
| `convertArchiveFile(path, options?)` | `ArchiveItem[]` | Every document inside a ZIP (#557): per entry `outcome` `converted` (`result`) / `skipped` (`error` = the reason) / `failed` (`error`); one broken document fails only itself. |
| `convertArchive(input, options?)` | `ArchiveItem[]` | Same, over in-memory bytes (`format` ignored). |
| `convertArchiveFileAsync` / `convertArchiveAsync` | `Promise<ArchiveItem[]>` | Off the event loop. |
| `streamFileMarkdown(path, options?)` | `AsyncGenerator<string>` | Markdown chunks in document order. |
| `chunkFile(path, options?)` | `Chunk[]` | Convert + run docling's hierarchical/hybrid chunker. |
| `chunk(input, options?)` | `Chunk[]` | Same, over in-memory bytes. |
| `chunkDocument(documentJson, options?)` | `Chunk[]` | Chunk an already-converted docling JSON document. |
| `chunkFileAsync` / `chunkAsync` / `chunkDocumentAsync` | `Promise<Chunk[]>` | Off the event loop. |
| `streamFileChunks` / `streamChunks` / `streamDocumentChunks` | `AsyncGenerator<Chunk>` | Chunks yielded as produced; `break` cancels. |
| `emailAttachmentsFile(path, options?)` | `EmailAttachment[]` | The attachments of an `.eml` / `.msg` with their payloads (#561): `{ index, name, contentType, format, size, inline, skipped, data }` — `data` a `Buffer` when kept (absent over a limit or without a payload), `format` the id it converts as (absent, with `skipped` saying why, when it will not), a forwarded message an `.eml` entry. Convert one with `convert({ name: att.name, data: att.data, format: att.format })` — `format` carries what the extension cannot (a `scan.bin` sent as `application/pdf`). `inline` is true for images of the body only; names are unique within the message (`report-2.pdf`). `options`: `maxEntries`, `maxEntrySize`, `maxTotalSize` (bytes; defaults the `DOCLING_RS_ZIP_MAX_*` limits: 10 000 / 256 MiB / 1 GiB). |
| `emailAttachmentsAsync` / `emailAttachmentsFileAsync` | `Promise<EmailAttachment[]>` | Off the event loop (a large `.msg` parses without blocking). |
| `emailAttachments(input, options?)` | `EmailAttachment[]` | Same, over in-memory message bytes (`{ name, data }`). |
| `supportedFormats()` | `string[]` | Supported input format ids. |
| `formatFromName(name)` | `string \| null` | Detect a format id from a filename/extension. |
| `checkDependencies(options?)` | `DependencyStatus` | Report which PDF/image deps are present. |

`Pipeline` is the reusable warm PDF/image converter: `new Pipeline(converterOptions)`
then `convertFile` / `convert` / `convertFileAsync` / `convertAsync` /
`convertFileStreaming` / `streamFileMarkdown`. It reads `strict`, the
enrichment switches and every PDF/image option (`ocrEngine`, `ocrLang`,
`ocrMode`, `ocrScale`, `noOcr`, `textLayerOnly`, `password`,
`forceFullPageOcr`, `noTextPanels`, `headingHierarchy`, `pages`, `imagesScale`,
`pageImages`) from
`converterOptions` (#471).

`DocumentConverter` is the reusable form: `new DocumentConverter(converterOptions)`
then `convert` / `convertFile` / `convertFileAsync` / `convertAsync` /
`convertFileStreaming` / `convertArchiveFile` / `convertArchive` (+ `*Async`).
Converter config (`strict`, `fetchImages`,
`allowedFormats`, `pipeline` + the `vlm*` options) is set once on the
constructor; output options (`to`, `imageMode`, `artifactsDir`) are per call.

### Options

- `to`: `"markdown"` (default), `"json"`, `"html"`, `"text"`, `"latex"`, `"vtt"`
  (WebVTT subtitles from an audio/video transcript or a `.vtt`, #614) or `"pandoc"`
  (Pandoc's JSON AST — pipe it to `pandoc -f json -t docx`; pictures follow
  `imageMode`).
- `imageMode`: `"placeholder"` (default), `"embedded"`, or `"referenced"`.
- `artifactsDir`: directory name used in `referenced` links (default `"artifacts"`).
- `pageBreakPlaceholder`: text inserted between pages in Markdown output —
  docling's `export_to_markdown(page_break_placeholder=…)`, e.g.
  `"<!-- page break -->"`. Pages come from the PDF/image pipeline, slides,
  sheets and DjVu pages; a break lands only between two rendered blocks on
  different pages (never first or last). Unset: no page breaks, docling's
  default. Markdown only.
- `strict`: cleaner, more conformant Markdown instead of docling's byte-for-byte
  legacy output (Markdown only).
- `fetchImages`: for HTML/EPUB, resolve and embed external `<img src>`. Off by
  default; fetches http(s) URLs over the network — enable only for trusted input.
- `allowedFormats`: restrict the converter to these format ids/extensions.
- `pages`: convert only this PDF page window, `"A-B"` or `"N"` (1-based inclusive).
- `ocrLang`: OCR recognition language for scanned pages, `"en"` (default) or
  `"ch"` (the multilingual docling-conformance model), or a BCP-47 tag for
  either language (`"en-US"`, `"eng"`, `"zh"`, `"zh-Hans"`, `"zh-TW"`; docling's
  `iso:` prefix accepted). Other languages are rejected.
- `forceFullPageOcr`: OCR every PDF page even when it carries a text layer
  (docling's `force_full_page_ocr`).
- `noTextPanels`: keep every detected picture as a picture — disable the
  demotion of uncaptioned dense-text "picture" regions into paragraphs (#173).
- `headingHierarchy`: infer PDF/image section-header levels after assembly
  (docling's `HeadingHierarchyModel`, #302): PDF bookmarks are authoritative,
  then legal/outline numbering, then font style. Off by default — headings
  then keep the flat detected level.
- `doPictureClassification` / `doCodeEnrichment` / `doFormulaEnrichment`: the
  opt-in enrichment models (docling's `PdfPipelineOptions` flags of the same
  names, #423) — classify pictures with DocumentFigureClassifier (26 classes
  on the JSON picture item), rewrite code blocks and detect their language
  with the CodeFormulaV2 VLM, decode display formulas to LaTeX. Off by
  default; each needs its model under `.models/` (`scripts/install/download_dependencies.sh --enrich`),
  a missing one warns and skips the pass. CodeFormula is an autoregressive VLM:
  expect seconds per code/formula region on CPU. Also read by `new Pipeline()`.
- `doPictureOcr`: OCR the pictures embedded in non-PDF documents (DOCX/PPTX
  screenshots, HTML figures, sampled video frames) with the OCR models and
  attach the text to the picture as docling's description annotation (#645):
  Markdown prints it between the caption and the image placeholder, the JSON
  picture item carries `meta.description` + the `description` annotation,
  chunks include it. `pictureOcrClasses` (comma-separated
  DocumentFigureClassifier labels, e.g.
  `"screenshot_from_computer,screenshot_from_manual"`) and
  `pictureOcrMinSide` (px, default 32) filter which pictures are read;
  `keepPictureImages: false` drops the image bytes after the pass. Off by
  default — every default output is unchanged.
- `redactPii`: redact personal data from the converted document before any
  output (#621, a docling.rs extension) — e-mail, phone, card numbers (Luhn),
  IBANs (mod-97), IP addresses, URL credentials, national IDs and, with the
  NER model under `.models/ner/`, names / organizations / locations; every
  string of the document model is rewritten, so Markdown, JSON, DCLX and
  chunks come out clean. `redactMode` (`"label"` | `"pseudonym"` |
  `"fixed:<text>"`), `redactKinds` (comma-separated), `redactPattern`
  (`NAME=REGEX` lines) and `redactImages` (`"drop"` | `"box_out"` | `"keep"`)
  tune it; the result's `redaction` is the counts per label. Also read by
  `new Pipeline()`.
- `asrModel` / `asrLang`: Whisper model preset and transcription language
  (`"auto"` default) for audio/video sources.
- `encoding`: character encoding of text inputs (Markdown, CSV, AsciiDoc,
  WebVTT, XML, …) — docling's `TextBackendOptions.encoding`, a WHATWG label
  such as `"shift_jis"` or `"koi8-r"`. Unset detects (BOM, UTF-8, then
  windows-1252); bytes the named encoding cannot decode fail the conversion.
- `videoFrames`: max frames sampled from a video input as timestamped pictures
  (`0` = transcript only; default 8, needs ffmpeg at runtime; `4294967295` =
  every distinct cut, #647).
- `videoSceneThreshold` / `videoFrameMaxSide` / `videoFrameDedupe` (#647):
  ffmpeg's scene score a frame must exceed to be a cut (0.27; 0.6 keeps hard
  cuts only), a cap on each frame's longer side applied inside ffmpeg (0 =
  source size), and the difference-hash distance (0–64) under which a frame
  is a duplicate of a kept one and dropped (unset = keep all; 4–6 collapses a
  re-lit slide). Frames stream one at a time through `doPictureOcr` +
  `keepPictureImages: false`, so a long lecture costs one frame of memory.
- `pipeline`: `"standard"` (default) or `"vlm"` — convert PDF/image pages
  through a remote vision endpoint instead of the ONNX stack (#77). See
  [VLM pipeline](#vlm-pipeline-remote-endpoint). The five `vlm*` options below
  take effect **only** under `"vlm"`; without it they are silently ignored.
- `vlmEndpoint`: the server's `/v1` base or the full `…/chat/completions` URL.
  Falls back to `DOCLING_RS_VLM_ENDPOINT`; required for `pipeline: 'vlm'`.
- `vlmModel`: model name as the server knows it. Falls back to
  `DOCLING_RS_VLM_MODEL`; required for `pipeline: 'vlm'`.
- `vlmApiKey`: Bearer token; local servers need none. Falls back to
  `DOCLING_RS_VLM_API_KEY`.
- `vlmPrompt`: overrides docling's per-page instruction. Falls back to
  `DOCLING_RS_VLM_PROMPT`.
- `vlmMaxTokens`: `max_tokens` per page completion (default `8192`).

### `ConvertResult`

```ts
interface ConvertResult {
  content: string          // Markdown or JSON, per `to`
  format: string           // detected input format id
  status: string           // "success" | "partial_success" | "failure"
  inputName: string
  images: { path: string; data: Buffer }[] // for the `referenced` image mode
}
```

Full TypeScript types are generated into `index.d.ts` / `native.d.ts`.

## Examples

The [`examples/`](examples) folder is a self-contained project that depends on
the published `docling.rs` package — `npm install` there, then run any of them:

```bash
cd examples
npm install
node node-basic.mjs        # ESM: file, bytes, JSON, reuse
bun run bun-basic.ts       # Bun + TypeScript: async + streaming
node pdf-pipeline.mjs       # warm Pipeline for PDFs (run scripts/install/download_dependencies.sh first)
```

- [`examples/node-basic.mjs`](examples/node-basic.mjs) — Node.js (ESM): file, bytes, JSON, reuse.
- [`examples/bun-basic.ts`](examples/bun-basic.ts) — Bun + TypeScript, with async and streaming.
- [`examples/pdf-pipeline.mjs`](examples/pdf-pipeline.mjs) — warm `Pipeline` for PDFs.

The smoke test exercises the locally-built addon instead: `npm run build` once at
the package root, then `node test/smoke.mjs` (or `bun test/smoke.mjs`).
