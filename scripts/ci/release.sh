# Master-only release step (run by .github/workflows/ci.yml after the lint/test
# gates pass). Computes the next version from the commits since the last tag
# (scripts/ci/bump_version.sh: fix:/perf:/revert:-only range -> patch, anything
# else -> the 0.x "major"; no automatic 1.0.0); if there is one, it bumps the
# workspace version, commits + tags it and pushes to master. A clean no-op
# when nothing landed since the last tag. Nothing is built, uploaded or
# released here: the GitHub Release for the tag is cut by release.yml when
# the maintainer publishes it (scripts/ci/release_notes.sh writes its notes
# from the tags then), and the crates go to crates.io from
# crates-publish.yml, one of the channels release.yml dispatches
# (scripts/ci/ci_publish.sh).
#
# The release commit is pushed with RELEASE_PAT (an admin token, so it satisfies
# the master branch ruleset) and carries `[skip ci]`, so it does not re-trigger CI.
#
# Set FORCE_VERSION=X.Y.Z to (re)release that exact version instead of computing it
# from the commit history — used to release a version a failed/blocked run skipped.

# Requires: push access to master.

# itself — the maintainer picks crates.io, PyPI, npm, Docker, the binaries —
# which is why the bindings count too: a Python- or Node-only merge (a new
